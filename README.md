## About The Project
With the rise of online shopping, switching to an online store has countless advantages. That's why we have chosen to create our own online clothing sales site, using Java Enterprise Edition.

The creation of an e-commerce site can be done in several ways and technologies, using J2EE technology with all the tools such as JSP, Servlet, REST and others, allow us to combine many skills either in Front-end or in Back-end in a single IDE, this is very practical and robust.
